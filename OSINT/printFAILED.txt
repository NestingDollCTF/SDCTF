download printFailed executable
open with ghidra or similar tool
find that program uses printf (a lot of vulns associated with it)
Connect via nc
Type:     %4$s       which gets the fourth argument (the flag)
You can confirm this is the flag by reconnecting and pasting in the argument to see that the program says “nice guess!”
Base64 decode to get flag
